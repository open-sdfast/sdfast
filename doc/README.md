The original source for the manual appears to have been lost. It was a FrameMaker document. All that remains is the pdf included here. If anyone has a dusty old CD with the FrameMaker source on it, please let us know.

FWIW an attempt has been made to convert the pdf to an editable Word ".docx" document, using Adobe's tool for that purpose. That conversion is also included here, though I believe much of the semantics is missing (e.g. the Index is there, but not linked to the text in any way so won't be automatically updated).
