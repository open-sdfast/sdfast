Four-Bar Mechanism Example

Introduction
------------

This is the example from Tutorial 1 of the new SD/FAST manual.  It shows a
very simple mechanism begin assembled, initialized and simulated with a very
simple Fortran driver program.  Reading the discussion in Tutorial 1 will be
very helpful in understanding this example.

The example is also provided in C.

Running the Example
-------------------

This example is composed of three files:

   fbar.doc -- this documentation file
   fbar.sd  -- the SD/FAST Input File
   fbar.f   -- user-written FORTRAN code driving the analyses
   fbarc.c  -- similar user-written driving program written in C

To generate, compile and link the Fortran example into an executable 
`fbar', execute the following commands (on Unix workstations):

   1. sdfast -ge fbar.sd  

      The -ge flag says `generate everything', so you get:
           fbar_info fbar_dyn.f fbar_sar.f sdlib.f

   2. f77 -o fbar fbar.f fbar_dyn.f fbar_sar.f sdlib.f 

      Compile, link and put the executable in `fbar'.  
      The -u and -C flags can also be very helpful
      for debugging.  If you will be changing fbar.f (a good idea for
      familiarizing yourself with the SD/FAST capabilities) you will want 
      to avoid recompilation of the other files.  That can be done using 
      the -c flag:
           f77 -c fbar_dyn.f fbar_sar.f sdlib.f
      and then linking with the appropriate object files:
           f77 -o fbar fbar.f fbar_dyn.o fbar_sar.o sdlib.o

To generate, compile and link the C example into an executable
`fbarc', execute the following commands:

   1. sdfast -lc -ge fbar.sd

      This generates everything, but in C instead of Fortran, so you
      get: fbar_info fbar_dyn.c fbar_sar.c sdlib.c

   2. cc -o fbarc fbarc.c fbar_dyn.c fbar_sar.c sdlib.c -lm

      Compile, link and put the executable in `fbarc'.  Again, you
      can avoid recompilation of the equations with the -c flag:
           cc -c fbar_dyn.c fbar_sar.c sdlib.c
      Then compile the driving program and link with
           cc -o fbarc fbarc.c fbar_dyn.o fbar_sar.o sdlib.o -lm
