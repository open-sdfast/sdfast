#  This is an SD/FAST input file describing the Humpage reduction gear
#  discussed in the Application Note "Modeling Gear Trains Using SD/FAST"
#  available from your SD/FAST distributor.
#
#  The system is modeled with four moving bodies and three gear
#  constraints.  The gear constraints are written as user constraints
#  in the accompanying driver program humpage.f.
