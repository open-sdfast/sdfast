Humpage Reduction Gear Example

Introduction
------------

This is the example from SD/FAST Application Note #005 "Modeling Gear Trains
Using SD/FAST".  It models an epicyclic gear train called a Humpage reduction
gear.  Ask your SD/FAST representative for a copy of the Application Note,
which explains the operation of the example program.

Running the Example
-------------------

This example is composed of three files:

   humpage.doc -- this documentation file
   humpage.sd  -- the SD/FAST Input File
   humpage.f   -- user-written FORTRAN code driving the analyses

To generate, compile and link this example into an executable `humpage',
execute the following commands (on Unix workstations):

   1. sdfast -ge humpage.sd  

      The -ge flag says `generate everything', so you get:
           humpage_info humpage_dyn.f humpage_sar.f sdlib.f

   2. f77 -o humpage humpage.f humpage_dyn.f humpage_sar.f sdlib.f 

      Compile, link and put the executable in `humpage'.
      The -u and -C flags can also be very helpful
      for debugging.  If you will be changing humpage.f (a good idea for
      familiarizing yourself with the SD/FAST capabilities) you will want 
      to avoid recompilation of the other files.  That can be done using 
      the -c flag:
           f77 -c humpage_dyn.f humpage_sar.f sdlib.f
      and then linking with the appropriate object files:
           f77 -o humpage humpage.f humpage_dyn.o humpage_sar.o sdlib.o
