Humpage Reduction Gear Example

Introduction
------------

This is the example from SD/FAST Application Note #006 "Modeling Orbit
and Attitude Dynamics Using SD/FAST".  It performs several different
orbital studies for a single body and a chain of bodies in orbit.
Ask your SD/FAST representative for a copy of the Application Note,
which explains the operation of the example programs.

Running the Example
-------------------

This example is composed of seven files:

   orbit.doc  -- this documentation file
   orbit.sd   -- the SD/FAST Input File for the single body in orbit
   orbitc.sd  -- the SD/FAST Input File for the chain in orbit
   orbit.f    -- user-written FORTRAN code: single body in perturbed orbit
   orbitrzv.f -- user-written FORTRAN code: a rendezvous maneuver (single body)
   orbitatt.f -- user-written FORTRAN code: attitude study (single body)
   orbitc.f   -- user-written FORTRAN code: motion of chain in orbit

To generate, compile and link this example into four executable programs
`orbit', `orbitrzv', `orbitatt', and `orbitc' execute the following 
commands (on Unix workstations):

   1. sdfast -ge orbit.sd  

      The -ge flag says `generate everything', so you get:
           orbit_info orbit_dyn.f orbit_sar.f sdlib.f

   2. sdfast orbitc.sd
    
      This generates: orbitc_info, orbitc_dyn.f, and orbitc_sar.f

   3. f77 -c orbit_dyn.f orbit_sar.f orbitc_dyn.f orbitc_sar.f sdlib.f 

      Compile all the SD/FAST-generated files.  This creates
           orbit_dyn.o orbit_sar.o orbitc_dyn.o orbitc_sar.o sdlib.o 

      You may see some messages like:
        WARNING: TEST MAY FAIL DUE TO FLOAING POINT IMPRECISION (781)
      These may safely be ignored.

   4. f77 -o orbit orbit.f orbit_dyn.o orbit_sar.o sdlib.o
      f77 -o orbitrzv orbitrzv.f orbit_dyn.o orbit_sar.o sdlib.o
      f77 -o orbitatt orbitatt.f orbit_dyn.o orbit_sar.o sdlib.o
      f77 -o orbitc orbitc.f orbitc_dyn.o orbitc_sar.o sdlib.o

      Compile the main programs, and link in the models to produce the
      four executables.  The -u and -C flags can also be very helpful
      for debugging.
