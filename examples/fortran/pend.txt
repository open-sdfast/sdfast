Pendulum Example

Introduction
------------

This is the example from Tutorial 2 of the SD/FAST manual.
It represents the simplest `multibody' system, a one-body pendulum.
Reading the discussion in the Tutorial will be very helpful in understanding 
this example.  

Running the Example
-------------------

This example is composed of three files:

   pend.doc -- this documentation file
   pend.sd  -- the SD/FAST Input File
   pend.f   -- user-written FORTRAN code driving the analyses

To generate, compile and link this example into an executable `pend',
execute the following commands (on Unix workstations):

   1. sdfast -ge pend.sd  

      The -ge flag says `generate everything', so you get:
           pend_info pend_dyn.f pend_sar.f sdlib.f

   2. f77 -o pend pend.f pend_dyn.f pend_sar.f sdlib.f 

      Compile, link and put the executable in `pend'.  
      The -u and -C flags can also be very helpful
      for debugging.  If you will be changing pend.f (a good idea for
      familiarizing yourself with the SD/FAST capabilities) you will want 
      to avoid recompilation of the other files.  That can be done using 
      the -c flag:
           f77 -c pend_dyn.f pend_sar.f sdlib.f
      and then linking with the appropriate object files:
           f77 -o pend pend.f pend_dyn.o pend_sar.o sdlib.o
