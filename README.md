SD/FAST open source code

SD/FAST is a symbolic multibody dynamics code sold by PTC since the 1990s. PTC has generously contributed it to open source in 2026. One of the original authors, Michael Sherman (Sherm) is modernizing the code and build system and will shortly update a free, buildable version. Please use the GitHub Discussion feature for questions, or file Issues if you have requests.
